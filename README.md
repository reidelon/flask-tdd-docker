# flask-tdd-docker
demo app in order to use flask following TDD and using docker

Be sure to modify the source code for the installation of Flask-RESTPlu replacing every instance of
`from werkzeug import cached_property` for `from werkzeug.utils import cached_property` in order to make the project works
I will try to fix this issue later
